          Each of these 5,000 dots represents one person who reported their height in a <a
            href="https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2018.html" target="_blank">national survey</a>.
          We're sampling people one at a time and updating our estimate of the average height on each side of the line
          as we go, shown in the bottom plot.
          The error bars represent uncertainty in estimating these averages.
          As we sample more and more people, our estimates settle down and our uncertainty decreases.

          <b>Believe it or not, after a few hundred samples we should have enough data to conclude that there's a
            statistically
            significant difference between heights on both sides of the line, <i>no matter where we draw the
              line!</i></b>

        So far we have sampled <span id="samples-taken">0</span> people and do not have statistical significance. This usually takes a few hundred points.

      <div id="explainer" style="display: none; text-align: left;">
        <p>
          So what exactly does this mean?
        </p>

        <p>
          Does it mean that there's a huge difference in heights on each side of the line?
        </p>
        <!-- all of the people on one side of the line are taller than the people on the other side of the line? -->

        <p>
          <center>
            <button id="show-all-button" class="btn btn-default" style="display: none;">Click here to see
              everyone's individual heights</button>
          </center>
        </p>

        <div id="rest-of-explainer" style="display: none;">
          <p>
            Of course not!
          </p>

          <p>
            All it means is that <b>it's unlikely that we would see these results if the true distribution of heights
              was
              <i>exactly the same</i> on both sides of the line</b>, so we declare statistical
            significance.
            <!-- if heights really were distributed exactly the same
          on both sides of the line, it's unlikely that we'd get the results we did -->
          </p>

          <p>
            This is of course a bit of a silly, because <b>we probably don't care whether things are <i>exactly</i> the
              same</b>
            on both sides of the line, but this is what many statistical analyses are designed to test.
          </p>

          <p>
            Instead, <b>we probably care about <i>how big the difference is</i></b> between each side of the line, which
            is
            known
            as the <i>effect size</i>.
          </p>

          <p>
            As you can see, there's a very small difference in average heights between both sides of the line. And of
            course not everyone is average.</p>

          <p>In short, <b>statistical significance doesn't mean practical
              significance</b>.
